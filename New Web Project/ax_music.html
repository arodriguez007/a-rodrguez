         <h2>Eternal Atake</h2>
		</header>
         <p>The Philly rapper has evolved into an untouchable pop artist in sound and style.
		 With deliriously good rapping and immaculate production, Uzi makes an event album live up to its name.
		 A typical Lil Uzi Vert song boils down to a few core topics: the millions in his bank account, the cars 
		 an average person wouldn’t know how to start, jewelry that wouldn’t shine on anyone else, clothing brands 
		 that most can’t pronounce, and girls who would never bat an eyelash at someone other than Uzi. But a typical 
		 Lil Uzi Vert song also sounds like it was ripped from a harddrive that fell out of the back of a spaceship, all 
		 delivered with a medley of influences from the generations that came before him. My personal favorite track would have to be <cite>Bigger Than Life</cite>.
		 <strong><cite>Eternal Atake: 9.5 / 10</cite></strong></p>

				<h3>Artist 2.0</h3>
			</header>
         <p>A Boogie is an incredibly dynamic artist with a range of different styles and a unique voice that works both 
		 rapping and singing. He shows off his eclecticism and evolution on Artist 2.0. A Boogie’s sound is his biggest priority. 
		 Above everything, the song needs that right sound. As he’s done throughout his career, he explores this sound with beat 
		 switches, voice alterations, and lyrical repetition. While these themes stay consistent, his only constant style is change. 
		 Reshape the sound. Reshape the sound multiple times per song. A Boogie updates his style on Artist 2.0 to separate this work 
		 from previous projects. My favorite track off the album would have to be <cite>Me & My Guitar</cite> as the mix of the trap beat and guitar work
		 incredibly well as the foundation of the song.

				<h4>BLAME IT ON BABY</h4>
			</header>
		 <p>With his popularity increasing over the last year dramatically, Dababy had alot to live up to for his next project. Ill make this 
		 as short and right to the point as I can... this project missed the mark by MILES. He repeatedly uses the same flow throughout the whole album only switching
		it up a few times. The Project overall felt bland and repetitive with the best song easily being 
		<cite>Rockstar feat. Roddy Ricch</cite>.   		 
		 <strong><cite>BLAME IT ON BABY: 3.5 / 10</cite></strong></p>

				<h5>My Turn</h5>
			</header>
		 <p>Lil Baby is slowly coming into his own as a Young Thug disciple with a unique sound and strong storytelling as it truly
		is his turn to shine. He’s got clear talent, and considering how much he’s improved just in the months since his last project, <cite> Street Gossip</cite>
		his ceiling is potentially massive. After listening to the album in its entirety, i found myself adding 14 out of the 20 tracks off the project to my playlists.
			I found when Lil Baby is at his best is when its just him speaking about his struggles and hardships going on in his life on his track <cite>Emotionally Scarred</cite>, which 
			just so happens to be my favorite track off the project.    
		 <strong><cite>My Turn: 7.5 / 10</cite></strong></p>
			<header>
				<h6>Please Excuse Me For Being Antisocial</h6>
			</header>
		 <p>With only having 2 prior projects before this one Roddy Ricch absoultely sticks the landing. With <cite>Please Excuse Me For Being Antisocial</cite> being his debut album the LA 
			artist has exceeded expections as he masterfully uses different flows and melodic tones throughout the entire project; even at many points in the middle of a song. 
			All that to say that it was difficult to choose what was my favorite track off the album. <cite>The Box, Perfect Time, Bacc Seat Feat. Ty Dolla $ign, & High Fashion</cite> would
			be some honorable mentions; however I will have to go with <cite>Boom Boom Room</cite> as my favorite track of Roddy Ricch's debut album.
