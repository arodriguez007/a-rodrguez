         <h2>NBA 2K19</h2>
		</header>
         <p>Because of the way NBA 2K18 fell off last year, I hoped that 
		 NBA 2K19 would fix any mistakes and issues its predecessor had 
		 and I was pleasantly surprised to see that 2K did massively improve 
		 on many bugs and issues 2K18 had. With the seemingly endless freelance 
		 offenses and scripted plays, the offensive A.I. in NBA 2K was already 
		 exceptional. In 2K19, the defensive A.I. has taken significant strides 
		 and this is another huge reason the gameplay has improved. I'm not just
		 talking about single-player traditional or head-to-head play. Even the NBA 
		 games in MyCAREER are more challenging and entertaining because of the realistic 
		 behaviors of A.I-controlled players in the half court and in transition. 
		 The balance between offense and defense was finally implemented in NBA 2K19. 
		 Whether you're a person who plays single-player, multiplayer, offline or online, 
		 this is one of the most complete sports game I've played in a while. Of Course there 
		 is no such thing as a perfect sports game, but NBA 2K19 is a step in the right direction.

				<h3>Red Dead Redemption 2</h3>
			</header>
         <p>Set in Rockstar Games' most authentic and lived-in open world ever, there are
		 so many things to do, so many people to meet, and so many places to explore it’s all satisfyingly overwhelming. 
		 Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of Rockstar Games' greatest achievements to date. A western tale of loyalty, 
		 conviction, and the price of infamy. The ability of this game to keep itself fresh after so many 
		 hours is extraordinary, and not entirely due to just the size and diversity of the world; it’s how 
		 alive all of those places feel. While the largely rural world of Red Dead Redemption 2 is far less 
		 dense than the likes of Grand Theft Auto V, it’s absolutely brimming with wildlife to discover, people 
		 to interact and potentially help as well as places to explore. The best kind of open worlds are those 
		 that seem almost like it requires your presence in them to make a difference. <strong><cite>Red Dead Redemption 2: 9.5 / 10</cite></strong></p>

				<h4>Fortnite</h4>
			</header>
		 <p>The popularity of this sandbox shooter's multiplayer mode has eclipsed the single-player, strategy-focused story, 
		 but no matter which you play, it's fast-paced and will keep you coming back for more. Fortnite: Battle Royale became 
		 perhaps the most popular game in the world by early 2018; its cartoonish take on last-player-standing gameplay has struck 
		 a chord with both casual and hard-core players. The gameplay isn't bloody or gory, but it demands that gamers be willing to 
		 go through many play sessions to improve their strategy and get better at surviving on the ever-shrinking battlefield.  Yes, 
		 there are some moments when players will defeat others and celebrate their misfortune, but the overall tone of a match is 
		 typically light and friendly, which is one of the reasons people are so eager to play "just one more." It's also notable 
		 that while there's a heavy push for purchasing items and animations, they're not necessary to fully enjoy the multiplayer 
		 experience. <strong><cite>Fortnite: 6.5 / 10</cite></strong></p>

				<h5>Overwatch</h5>
			</header>
		 <p>Overwatch is an incredible achievement in multiplayer shooter design. It bobs and weaves almost perfectly between being 
		 the quick-fix adrenaline hit you might want after a long day of work, and the thoughtful, strategic multiplayer experience 
		 that becomes the center of evening-long play sessions with friends. It might not have the most exhaustive list of maps and modes, 
		 but it provides a diversity in the heroes it allows you to choose to hit the battlefield with. All the current 29 characters 
		 (all of whom are unlocked from the start) are roughly grouped into one of four “roles” Offense, Defense, Tank & Support. Remarkably,
		 Blizzard has managed to make 29 individual heroes all feeling like separate characters so not one character feels like any other.  
		 Needless to say that Overwatch gives you endless opportunities for exhilarating, coordinated play, and when you’re the one at the center of it,
		 it feels like nothing else. <strong><cite>Overwatch: 8.5 / 10</cite></strong></p>

				<h6>Spider-Man PS4</h6>
			</header>
		 <p>At its core, Insomniac Games new adventure strives to make you feel like Spider-Man. Thankfully, Marvel's Spider-Man on PS4 succeeds 
		 at doing just that and more. I was left speechless and engrossed at nearly every step of its 15-hour adventure thanks to a surprisingly 
		 deep story that nicely depicts both Spider-Man and Peter Parker to great emotional success. Undermining the riveting narrative is an
		 excellent set of web swinging mechanics, which when combined with fun gadgets and plenty of puns makes for thrilling action in both the massive 
		 set pieces and in the quiet, confined areas of intense sequences. <strong><cite>Spider-Man PS4: 9 / 10</cite></strong></p>
